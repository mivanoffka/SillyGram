# **What is SillyGram?**

SillyGram is a lightweight Python framework for building Telegram bots, built on top of aiogram.

Telegram bots often function similarly to simple GUI applications. While creating such bots isnâ€™t inherently difficult, it typically involves writing a significant amount of repetitive code, which can distract you from focusing on the core business logic.

SillyGram aims to streamline the development process by enabling developers to design bots at a higher level of abstraction.

With SillyGram, you can create bots as a collection of pages and buttons, without worrying about the underlying low-level chat functionalities.
